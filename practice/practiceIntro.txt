Howdy folks

this audio track is the practice edition for the piece you'll be performing. This piece consists of breathing, snapping, clapping, humming, and singing, and I will tell you when to start each action. This practice tape will include all of these components. The actual performance will include them in a different order and a different number of times, which varies based on the number of performers available, among many other things. A few notes before we start:
When I ask you to sing or hum, you will hear a piano note. hum or sing this note in any octave, any vowel shape, any timbre you like. Shape it, and make the whole thing sound musical. You got this.
Secondly, when I tell you to snap or clap, there may be some delay between when I first warn you and when the first action comes. Be ready, and don't let yourself get lost in thoughts!

Alright, lets get going!
